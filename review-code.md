# Code Review Process

Perform a comprehensive review of all uncommitted changes (staged and unstaged) and produce prioritized action items.

## What this does

- Gathers and reviews all uncommitted changes in the current branch
- Produces a prioritized list of action items with file:line references

## Steps

1. **Collect change context:**
   - `git status --porcelain`
   - `git diff`
   - `git diff --cached`
   - `git diff HEAD`
   - `git log --oneline -n 5`

2. **Analyze changes for security, performance, style, consistency, missing edge cases, dependency impacts, and integration risks.**

3. **Output a summary and a single prioritized action list using indicators:**
   - 🔴 must-fix
   - 🟡 recommended
   - 🟢 consider
